### Group/Final Project
An action adventure game with a spell based combat system. The map features 5 distinct areas, each with signs, enemies, interesting terrain, and even some easter eggs. The combat system features different enemy types, enemy statuses, 6 unique element types with endless interactions, and special signs around the map to help the player learn these interactions. Additionally, there is a shop system where the player can buy items and gear to help them on their quest to defeat the 3 bosses. 

I made the maps, signs, obstacles to block player movement, a function to read a text file that can make said obstacles, the item class, the weapon class, button functionality in battles, health bars, special backgrounds based on the area the enemy is in, and a special jumpscare in the sand area. 

I helped with creating the shop system, desinging the combat system, implementing the combat system, the animation system, and designing boss gimmicks. 

I didn't do things like the art and implementing boss gimmicks.
